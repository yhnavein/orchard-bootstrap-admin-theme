Orchard Bootstrap Admin Theme
=============================

Extended admin theme for [Orchard framework](http://www.orchardproject.net/) which fully integrates the admin panel with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html), [jquery DataTables](http://datatables.net/), [jquery validationEngine](https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine), etc.
Great for custom development in Orchard framework in admin panel.

## Content

This theme contains following libraries, packages:

* **[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html)** v. 2.2.2 *(both styles, scripts and sprites)*
* **[jquery DataTables](http://datatables.net/)** v. 1.9.4 *with package to integrate Bootstrap styles into dataTables*
* **[Date.js](http://www.datejs.com/)** v. 1.0 Alpha-1 
* **[jquery validationEngine](https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine)** v. 2.6.1

## Installation

1. Just clone repository to your **Themes** directory in your Orchard installation
2. Login to your admin panel in your Orchard installation
3. Go to Themes and click Enable below the **Bootstrap Admin Theme**

**Warning!** Please **do not** click *Set as current* below **Bootstrap Admin Theme**

## Gallery

As soon as Orchard Gallery starts working as expected e.g. will allow to upload a contribution, I will upload package with this theme. 
For now you can clone repository or download content of this repo as a ZIP file.

## Further development

This is only a custom admin theme and there are improvements that simply cannot be done only by extending theme. 
Orchard framework also wasn't written in best way (in UX and design categories), so if you are willing for more improvements in this framework which fully integrates with Bootstrap please visit my Orchard fork where I am currently working on UX and design improvements.

**[Orchard Bootstrap Admin](http://orchard.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/Floubadour/OrchardBootstrapAdmin)** - fork of Orchard *v. 1.6*

Maybe it will be integrated in main Orchard one day...
